It is use by people with a penis who can simulate vaginal sex. This is also know as a masturbator. The most safe partner  you can have no matter what is your relationship status. I purchased one online through a pornhub ad over 10 years ago.

### The Power of the fleshlight.


I will admit I probably watched the ads for several months or years before actually buying one. The alternative was a ziplock bag and cooking oil which did the trick but was very  expensive and messy overtime. The  fleshlight allows you to have a pretty close simulation through having penis vagina sex without all the headaches of having a physical girl present. 

I will say that I have used it while in a relationship and being single. I have been using it for over ten years now. I purchased several and they don’t need to be replace often but there are some setbacks.

You need to use water soluble lubricant like ( think astroglide ) if you use oil or soap it is designed to break down. I think that is deliberate actually. I figured out other ways to avoid spending so much for water based lubricant but I will admit that it really is worth it.

## Adding the porn element to the mix.

Now with the right instruments in place I can enjoy a porn video o fly choice with position of the chair and television without having to move so much. When I first tried out the fleshlight it make me ejaculate after a few seconds. With the grip of my hands on the fleshlight and sensation the lubricant and fleshlight I couldn’t take it lol. 

It took a few months to build up stamina and with the right  medical treatments you can induce a level of euphoria that is beyond what you could find physically. It becomes  like a interactive video game and I am 
Player, user and enemy all at the same time. 



## How I use a fleshlight 


The flashlight comes with a case that you are told to use to simulation suction of air with adjusting the valve at the Botton of the casing but I prefer to remove the “sleeve” from the casing and use it around a soft blanket and a towel to catch any fluid that leaks out. 

Everything can be washed properly but the fleshlight sleeve must be cleaned with water only hot water and maybe some alcohol that will prevent bacteria from growing. 

To be honest your own “flora” on your skin will not harm you but if not properly clean can leave a strange odor from all the bacteria farting Laugh Out Loud..

## Warming up the fleshlight 

I started to warm up the fleshlight with hot water in a bag or a bottle but this is time consuming but worth it when I am using it during the cold winter months. I prefer to use today just recently with a sleeve warmer that cost an additional 30 dollars but was worth it .
The USB charger can be plugged into the computer or wall socket and keep the sleeve warm until I am ready to use.

A warm sleeve is way better than a cold one but I don’t mind using either if necessary.


## Using a fleshlight with my partner.

A fleshlight is way better with a partner but a fleshlight would never compete with her thighs.  My penis in between her warm thighs conniver be replaced. The fleshlight is good if you can not have sex or if your partner is on their period and you need a way experience the intimacy with the “bloody mess” Laugh Out Loud.


I have had some relationships	that went south because some of them considered a fleshlight cheating I was  not going to argue about using it since I am able to relax and study, sleep, workout with the ability to create my own little “reward” whenever I want.
Women with there vibrator might understand.


## Conclusion

I would recommend all people with penis to consider buying one because you will not fully understand what I am talking about until you tried it. Masturbation with my hand was something I could never enjoy and vaginal sex is not in infinite supply. So this comes pretty fucking close and I highly recommend it

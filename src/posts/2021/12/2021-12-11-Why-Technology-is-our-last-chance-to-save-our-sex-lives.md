When it coes to a relationship between two people, in order for it to 
last you must have a good sex life. Sex is more mental then physical.
It all starts within the mind and in order to keep your sex life 
exciting you need to worry about your mental health as well.

# Sex and Psychology Podcast: Episode 64 How technology can save your sex life.

This podcast episode really helped me kickoff this blog post. I  am interested in learning how to maintain the spices of a relationship. 
My partner and I have been together for a while now and I think about what happens when things may go a little south. If we can find a way to rekindle that passion we had when we first met.

In this episode Isharna Walsh CEO of coral discusses Her company's new app called Coral a Sexual Wellness app  with Dr. Justin Lehmiller the host of the podcast. The problem Isharna discussed was that humans have a problem discussing their feeling with other due to a number of factors. Whether it stems from childhood, a traumatic event in their personal lives or just staleness in the relationship.

The Coral App [Coral App](https://getcoral.app/) is an app that tries to help people find deeper connections , enhanced pleasure and obtain 
unshakable confidence with their bodies and to learn how to ask for it. Coral states on their website that ["Nothing that is so essential to our health and happiness is so neglected"](https://getcoral.app/about)

Me personally have struggled getting my views across with my partner about other interests I have in the bedroom such as having a threesome or polyamory. It is a big topic cause it puts us in a situation that there may be a change in our relationship for example One of us may leave the other for another person. 

Nothing has been brought to the table clearly as of yet. I do feel that I would rather know the truth rather then be in a relationship that only keeps us far from it. Perhaps I will try this out myself first before offering it to someone else.

Him/he. A software person. United States.

### Why I am making a blog about what dating, sex, relationships.


I am a avid believer in being honest and open about myself and what I like. The problems that comes with that sometimes is that you
tend to offend people and many people will secretly used it against you. I am a regular American citizen, works, pay taxes and enjoys
erotic media from the following

    - Adult Film Industry (porn).　ポルノ　AV女優　
    - Japanese doujinshi comic books　同人誌
    - Erotic video gams eroge エロゲ
    - I am interested in the scientifc research that backs my beliefs since I 
        started to stop caring what other people thinks


This blog is going to be a weekly or biweekly blog post about things I wanted to talk about  but never had the time to 
sit down and actually do it because of LIFE now that the pandemic has slowed life down a bit . I can start writing 
and planning projects  that I always wished to create.  I spent a great deal of time in  traveling and speaking to people 
from all walks of life and I wish to share my experience with others online whether people read it or not is not my problem.

The misconceptions of what I was suppose to do with my life has really messed with me on a mental level and  only now am 
I coming to the realization is that life is what you make it. I  would hope I would find more people interested in doing the same 
things and even translate the blog into other languages if needed be.

The first few topics I have talked about is my insatiable lust and hunger for women of the plus size  style. I was blessed to 
meet one  during my college years who made me realize that  sometime trying something new is very important when you are  wandering 
through life.

Thanks to Instagram as well to allow my mind to create aalternate  fantasy of what I can desire and think about. 
THis site is off any social media platform so I don't have to curb what I say or think. I will be creating links 
and photos to upload to social media about what I am posting here but to protect my images from getting taken down and lost 
forever it is better i start off them first.

If you  wish to say hi or you want to talk  and share stories please  email lrnecgcysiam at gmail dot com.
